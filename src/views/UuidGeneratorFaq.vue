        <h3 class="h3"> What is a UUID? </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit identifier that is unique across both space and time. It is
        commonly used in software development for various purposes, such as uniquely identifying entities.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> How is a UUID structured?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> A UUID is typically represented as 32 hexadecimal digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens. For
        example, 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 or as the Nil/Empty variant: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> What are the different versions of UUIDs?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> There are several UUID versions, including version 1 (time-based), version 2 (DCE Security), version 3 (MD5 hash),
        version 4 (random), and version 5 (SHA-1 hash).</p>

        <h3 class="h3">  When to use UUID version 1?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> UUID version 1 is generated based on the current timestamp and node (usually the MAC address). It's suitable for
        scenarios where time-based ordering is important, such as in distributed systems.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> When to use UUID version 4?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> UUID version 4 is generated using random or pseudo-random numbers. It's suitable for scenarios where uniqueness is
        more critical than time-based ordering.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> What is a namespace in UUID version 3 and 5?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">  UUID versions 3 and 5 involve hashing a namespace identifier and a name to create a UUID. The namespace provides a
        way to avoid collisions between different sets of names.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> Can UUIDs be predicted or duplicated?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> The probability of generating the same UUID is extremely low, especially for version 4 UUIDs that use random
        numbers. However, it's not impossible, and precautions should be taken in critical applications.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> How can I validate a UUID?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">  Valid UUIDs adhere to the specified format. You can use regular expressions or this app to validate a UUID and determine its Version.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> Can UUIDs be used as security tokens?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> While UUIDs are not designed for cryptographic security, they can be used as identifiers. For security-sensitive
        applications, additional measures such as encryption should be considered.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> Is there a performance impact when using UUIDs as primary keys in databases?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> While UUIDs may have a slightly higher storage overhead compared to sequential integers, modern databases are optimized to handle UUIDs efficiently. Considerations may vary based on the specific use case and database system.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> What is the difference between UUID and GUID?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) and GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) are often used interchangeably. UUID is
        more commonly used in the context of open standards, while GUID is commonly associated with Microsoft technologies.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> Can UUIDs be used as primary keys in databases?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> Yes, you can store UUIDs as strings or binary data in databases that do not have native UUID support. Be sure to use a consistent format and handle conversions appropriately.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> Can I use UUIDs in databases that do not support a native UUID type?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> Yes, UUIDs an be used in URLs, but it's recommended to encode them to ensure proper handling, especially in
        situations where certain characters might be problematic.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> How secure are UUIDs for sensitive data or cryptographic purposes?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> Yes, UUIDs an be used in URLs, but it's recommended to encode them to ensure proper handling, especially in
        situations where certain characters might be problematic.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> How do I generate multiple UUIDs at once?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> While UUIDs are not intended for cryptographic security, they can be used as identifiers in secure systems. For cryptographic purposes, additional measures, such as proper key management, are recommended.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> What is the significance of the timestamp in UUID version 1?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> The timestamp in UUID version 1 represents the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since the UUID epoch (1582-10-15). </p>
            
        <h3 class="h3"> Can I use UUIDs in URLs?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph"> Yes, UUIDs an be used in URLs, but it's recommended to encode them to ensure proper handling, especially in
        situations where certain characters might be problematic.</p>
